# Day 4 Guided/Independent Practice: jQuery Selectors Whack-a-mole!

Oh no, my yard is infested with moles! Help me whack them! Let's use jQuery to remove each mole. 

## Guided Practice: 
1. Let's start with the first mole at the top. It has the class `mole1`. Fix the code provided on lines 1-3 so that the mole disappears when you click on its  "Whack Me!" button. 
*Hint: You'll need to change the selector from "INCORRECT" to the name of the button you want to click.*

## Independent Practice:
2. On lines 5-8, fill in the click handler to get rid of the second mole. 
3. On lines 9-11, write the click handler to get rid of the third mole. Make sure to reference the HTML to find the appropriate selectors! Feel free to reference the first two click handlers to help your write this one.


## Spicy Challenge! (If you have time):
4. Lastly, write another click handler that will let us play this game again when someone presses the "Rest Moles" button. When this button is pressed, all the moles should show. 
5. Now if you've ever dealt with moles you know that you can never get rid of them! In addition to hiding the third mole, make the other moles appear when a user clicks the third mole.
